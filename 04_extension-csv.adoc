This document specifies the DAP4 CSV data encoding, how DAP4 servers can
advertise support for the DAP4 CSV encoding, and how DAP4 clients can
request DAP4 CSV encoded data responses.

The DAP4 CSV data encoding represents DAP4 data as structured
Comma-Separated Values (CSV) in UTF-8 text. Though based on the
_text/csv_ media type described in RFC
4180[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4_Extension:_CSV_Data_Encoding_and_Response#RFC_4180[RFC 4180]],
the DAP4 CSV is more complex so that it can fully represent the more
complex data structures of the DAP4 data model. Some structure beyond
simple CSV is necessary to capture the DAP4 data structures.

As with requests for data in the DAP4 binary data encoding described in
Volume 1 of the DAP4 specification
[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4_Extension:_CSV_Data_Encoding_and_Response#DAP4_Vol1[DAP4 Vol1]],
requests for DAP4 CSV encoded data can be constrained to a subset by
using a standard DAP4 Constraint Expression [DAP4 CE]

== DAP4 Extension Details ==

The Role URI for the DAP4 CSV Data Encoding and Response extension is

....
http://services.opendap.org/dap4/extension/text-csv-data
....

DAP4 servers MUST include this role URI in a Dataset Service Response
[DSR] _extension_ element to indicate that the DAP4 CSV Data Encoding
and Response extension is supported for the dataset (?represented by
that DSR?). DAP4 clients MAY check for DSR *extension* elements with
this role URI to determine if the DAP4 CSV Data Encoding and Response
extension is supported.

Dataset Service Response [DSR] _extension_ elements must also contain a
name and a description. The following are recommended text for the name
and description:

*Name* +
DAP4 CSV Data Encoding and Response

*Description* +
This extension provides an encoding for representing DAP4 data as
structured Comma-Separated Values (CSV) in UTF-8 text.
