*_Abstract_*

_While Volume 1 of the DAP4 specification addresses the detailed
semantics and structure of the DAP4 data and metadata content, this
volume (Volume 2) details the manner in which clients can request things
from a DAP4 server and what things the clients can expect to receive
from a DAP4 server in response to their requests. The description of
this interaction focuses on DAP4 clients and servers that are
communicating via HTTP, and while this is perceived by the authors as
the most common transport for DAP4 client/server interaction the
specification is written in a broad enough manner to allow for other
transport mechanisms._

=== [#Introduction .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#1# Introduction#

This document defines the DAP4 Web Service protocol which DAP4-compliant
software MUST support when utilizing the HTTP protocol to transmit DAP4
requests and responses, along with additional optional services that
DAP4-compliant software SHOULD support.

The DAP4 protocol uses three basic responses to represent a data
resource. One response, the Dataset Metadata Response (DMR) contains
metadata information describing the structure of the data resource. That
is, it characterizes the variables, their datatypes, names and
attributes. The second response, the Data Response (DataDMR), contains
both the metadata about the requested data and the actual data that was
requested. The third basic response is the Dataset Services Response
(DSR) that provides a listing of services, any alternate media
representations if available, and all of the associated access URI’s for
a particular data resource.

The DAP4 protocol uses a fourth basic resource, the Constraint/Query
Expression (CE), to represent subsetting of and, possibly,
transformations of the dataset requested.

The DAP4 protocol uses a fifth basic resource, the Error Response (ER),
to allow servers to communicate error information with clients. When a
request for any of the three basic responses cannot be completed, an
Error response is returned. If an error occurs before the standard
response is initiated, an error response is returned in place of the
standard response. If an error occurs after a data response has been
initiated, an Error Response is returned as the final chunked record as
described in Section 7 "`DAP4 Chunked Data Representation`" of the DAP4
Data Model
document.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#DAP4_Vol1[DAP4 Vol.1]]

The DAP4 Data Model, constraint/query language, dataset metadata XML
encoding, and binary data encoding are all defined in the DAP4 Volume 1:
"`Data Model, Persistent Representations, and Constraints`"
document.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#DAP4_Vol1[DAP4 Vol.1]]

Each of the three responses (Dataset Metadata, Data, and Dataset
Services) are complete in and of themselves so that, for example, the
Data response can be used by a client without ever requesting either of
the two other responses. In many cases, client programs will request the
Dataset Metadata response before requesting the Data response but there
is no requirement they do so and servers SHALL NOT require that behavior
on the part of clients.

These three standard dataset responses can each be accessed in two
different ways. First, similar to DAP2 URL construction and to support
client-driven content negotiation (see the section titled
https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#Content_Negotiation_and_Media_Types["`HTTP
- Content Negotiation and Media Types`"] below), each dataset resource
has a standard URL suffix that can be added to the DAP4 dataset URL to
retrieve the resource in its standard (normative) encoding. This allows
clients, given a base DAP4 dataset URL, to construct DAP4 URLs in a
simple and standard way for each of the three standard dataset
resources.

Second, to support server-driven content negotiation (see the
https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#Content_Negotiation_and_Media_Types["`HTTP
- Content Negotiation and Media Types`"] section below) and
hypermedia-driven style, a DAP4 resource role is defined for each
standard dataset resource and a DAP4 media type is defined for each
dataset resource encoding scheme.

Any particular instance of a DAP4 server MAY have one or more additional
services, alternate media representations of service responses, or
unique (to the server instance) server side functions. All of these
things, including the core services and their default representations
MUST be included in the _Dataset Services
Response_.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#DAP4_DSR[DAP4 DSR]]

The DAP4 web service is currently limited to HTTP GET requests though it
is expected that extensions (e.g., asynchronous access) will use other
HTTP methods (e.g., POST). This makes, for now, the DAP4 Constraint
Expression something of a pseudo-resource type given that they are
encoded as part of the URL query string rather than as an independent
document.

=== [#Terms_and_Definitions .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#2# Terms and Definitions#

Dataset Service Response (DSR) +
The DAP4 response type that contains a list of DAP (and other) services
available for the dataset including any alternate media representations
and all the associated access URIs.

Dataset Metadata Response (DMR) +
The DAP4 response type that contains metadata information describing the
structure of the requested data. The metadata information characterizes
the requested data variables including their names, data types, shapes,
and attributes.

Dataset Data Response (Data) +
The DAP4 response type that contains both the dataset metadata and the
binary data for the requested data.

Resource role ID +
A URI that identifies the role of a resource, generally provided with a
link to allow clients to identify the type of resource the link
references. (For instance, an "`atom:link`" element has an optional
"`atom:rel`" attribute.)

Media Type +
A internet media type is a two-part identifier for resource encoding
schemes, e.g. "`text/html`", "`text/plain`",
"`application/octet-stream`". (See
https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#MediaTypes[section
1.1 DAP4 Resource Roles and Media Types] of this document)

DAP4 Constraint Expression (CE) +
The constraint expression that encapsulates various sub-setting of, and
possibly the application of server side functions to variables in a DAP4
dataset.

Query String (QS) +
Everything after the "``+?+``" character in a URL.

* DAP4 Volume 1: "`Data Model, Persistence Representations, and
Constraints`"
* DAP4 Web Service (this document)
* DAP4 Dataset Services
* DAP4 Requirements for Server-side Functions

==== [#Extensions_to_DAP4_Core_Specifications .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#2.3# Extensions to DAP4 Core Specifications#

Several types of extensions can be made to the DAP4 core including:

* New encodings for the core DAP4 response types
* New response types
* New server-side functions.

=== [#DAP4_Web_Service_Responses .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3# DAP4 Web Service Responses#

The core of the DAP4 Web Service protocol consists of the four standard
response types: Dataset Services Response (DSR), Dataset Metadata
Response (DMR), Dataset Data Response (Data), DAP4 Error Response
(Error) Each dataset served by a DAP4 compliant server MUST provide the
DSR, DMR, and Data responses and MUST return errors documents as DAP4
Error Responses.

All of the example requests described below are based on the DAP4
dataset URL:

http://server.org:8080/dap/path/data.nc

==== [#DAP4_Dataset_Services_Response .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3.1# DAP4 Dataset Services Response#

The DAP4 Dataset Services Response
(DSR)[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#DAP4_DSR[DAP4 DSR]]
provides clients with a listing of all available DAP4 services and all
the available encodings for those services as well as all available DAP4
extensions.

Each service (or response type) has a unique resource role (defined in
the appropriate specification), each link (alternate representation) for
a given service MUST fulfill that same role. This is not always a clear
distinction to make. For example, the DAP4 Dataset Metadata Response can
be mapped into ISO 19115 metadata. However, IS0 19115 is clearly a
different domain.

The DAP4 Dataset Services Response MUST contain the following
information:

* List of DAP versions supported by server
* The implementation version (e.g., "`TDS 4.3.57`" or "`Hyrax 1.7.45`")
* List of all available DAP4 services for the dataset
* For each DAP4 services listed, a list of all available links each with
its corresponding media type
* List of supported extensions
** Resource type extensions
** Media type extensions
** Server-side function extensions

If SHOULD contain the following information:

* A human readable title for the dataset
* A human readable title for each service

To take advantage of web caching, servers should try to keep DSRs light
weight (i.e., quick creation) and as stable as possible.

===== [#DSR_Resource_Role .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3.1.1# DSR Resource Role#

DSRs are identified by the resource role:

*`+http://services.opendap.org/dap4/dataset-services+`*

===== [#Normative_Encoding_of_the_DSR .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3.1.2# Normative Encoding of the DSR#

The normative XML representation for the Dataset Services Response is
defined in the "`Normative XML Encoding of the DSR`" appendix. The media
type for the normative XML representation is

`+application/vnd.opendap.dataset-services+xml+`

===== [#Service_Behavior .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3.1.3# Service Behavior#

When an HTTP GET request is made on a base DAP4 dataset URL, all DAP4
servers MUST return the normative XML encoding of the DSR given these
conditions:

media type,
* the request "`Accept`" header equals "`*/*`", or
* the request "`Accept`" header does not indicate a preference for
another media type in which the server knows how to encode the DSR.

For example, the request:

....

When an HTTP GET request is made on a base DAP dataset URL with the
suffix `+.xml+` +
added to it:

request url = `+dataset_url.xml+`

the response MUST be the normative representation of the DSR along with

==== [#Dataset_Metadata_Response .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3.2# Dataset Metadata Response#

The Dataset Metadata Service returns the Dataset Metadata Response (DMR)
which is a metadata description of the dataset. The normative
representation of the DMR is an XML document that contains both the
'`syntactic`' (structural) and '`semantic`' metadata for the dataset,
persisted as a DAP4 data model representation of the dataset held at the
server.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#DAP4_Vol1[DAP4_Vol1]]
The DMR service accepts a query string (constraint expression) that
allows you to inspect the effects on the data structures when
sub-setting and/or server side functions are applied. If a constraint
expression has been successfully applied, the service will returned the
constrained view of the dap:Dataset object. The constrained view may
contain different data structures than the unconstrained view as the
constraint may alter the reasonable representation of the data set. Note
that all dap:Attribute objects have been removed from constrained
dap:Dataset objects. More information on the syntax of DAP4 constraint
expressions can be found in Volume 1 of the DAP4 specification.

the Dataset Metadata Response (an XML document described Volume 1 of the
DAP4 specification
[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#DAP4_Vol1[DAP4_Vol1]])
when a client attempts to access a dataset URL with the suffix
"``+.dmr+``" appended to it. The DAP4 server MAY return alternate
representations if the client indicates that it can accept them and the
server can provide them.

When an HTTP GET request is made on a base DAP dataset URL with the
suffix `+.dmr+` added to it:

request url = `+dataset_url + '.dmr'+ [?dap_constraint]+`

the server MUST reply with an normative representation of the DMR for

* the request "`Accept`" header equals "`*/*`", or
* the request "`Accept`" header does not indicate a preference for
another media type in which the server knows how to encode the DMR.

For example, the request:

....
GET /dap/path/data.nc.dmr HTTP/1.1
Host: server.org:8080

While the normative representation of the the Dataset Metadata response
is already an XML document, the normative media type is
`+application/vnd.opendap.dataset-metadata+xml+` which may be unfamiliar
to many generic clients (such as web browsers) and it is quite
conceivable that such a client might ask for the more generic

==== [#DAP4:_Data_Response .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3.3# DAP4: Data Response#

The Data Service provides DAP4 data access to a dataset, and is the
(primary) way that DAP4 returns data to a client. The Data service
accepts a query string (constraint expression) which allows you to
subset the data and invoke server side functions. When the service is
invoked it returns the DAP4 data object. On the wire this is a binary
document with MIME type _application/vnd.opendap.dap4.data_. The payload
is broken into two logical parts: A DMR-type xml document that describes
the data and a BLOB that contains the actual data. For more on the
information on the Data response and the internal structure of its
payload along with a complete discussion of the DAP4 constraint

==== [#DAP4_Error_Response .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3.4# https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4_Error_Response[DAP4 Error Response]#

The DAP4 protocol returns error information using an Error response. If
a request for any of the three basic responses cannot be completed then
an Error response is returned in its place.

The normative XML representation for the Error Response is defined by
the following RELAX-NG schema.

....
<grammar xmlns="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0"
                xmlns:doc="http://www.example.com/annotation"
                datatypeLibrary="http://xml.opendap.org/datatypes/dap4"
                ns="http://xml.opendap.org/ns/DAP/4.0#"
                >
<start>
  <ref name="errorresponse"/>
</start>
<define name="errorresponse">
  <element name="Error">
    <optional>
      <attribute name="httpcode"><data type="dap4_integer"/></attribute>
    </optional>
    <optional>
      <interleave>
        <element name = "Message"><text/></Message>
        <element name = "Context"><text/></Message>
        <element name = "OtherInformation"><text/></Message>
      </interleave>
    </optional>
  </element>
</define>
....

The Error element has one optional attribute: the _httpcode_ which is a
standard HTTP protocol return code indicating the general class of
error. When possible, this code should match the return code in the HTTP
headers for the response.

The body of the <Error> element may contain any or all of the following
inner elements each containing arbitrary text.

[arabic]
. <Message> — A short informative message describing the error.
. <Context> — Information describing the context in which the error
occurred: position of a parse error in a constraint expression, for
example.
. <OtherInformation> — Arbitrary additional text information: a Java
stack trace, for example.

===== [#Error_Response_Resource_Role .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3.4.1# Error Response Resource Role#

===== [#Normative_Encoding_of_the_Error_Response .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#3.4.2# Normative Encoding of the Error Response#

The normative XML representation for the Error Response is defined in
Appendix x "`Normative XML Encoding of the Error Response`". The media
type for the normative XML representation is:

`+application/vnd.opendap.dap4.error.xml+`

=== [#HTTP .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4# HTTP#

The DAP4 Web Services specification describes the features of HTTP that
are required to be a compliant DAP4 client or server. It does not
attempt to describe all aspects of HTTP that DAP4 servers might
implement or that DAP4 clients may see in response to DAP4 requests.
Similarly, it does not cover all issues related to the performance and
scalability of HTTP.

However, the following sections include both DAP4 requirements as well
as some suggestions of HTTP features that servers and clients are
encouraged to use.

==== [#Content_Negotiation_and_Media_Types .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.1# Content Negotiation and Media Types#

Though the DAP4 core specifications only describe one encoding for each
type of resource, DAP4 web servers MAY have the ability to provide a
given resource in a number of different media types. All media types
available for a resource MUST be listed in the DAP4 Dataset Services
response document.

DAP4 responses MUST use the "`Content-Type`" header field to identify
the media type of the DAP4 response body. For example, the normative
value for the XML encoded DMR response is
_application/vnd.opendap.dap4.dataset-metadata+xml_.

The DAP4 Dataset Services response describes the available services and
their media types, and through this description provides DAP4 software
(client and/or server) with two different mechanisms to negotiate for
different kinds of media representations. The first mechanism is
server-driven content negotiation as described in the HTTP 1.1
specification, section 12, "`Content
Negotiation`".[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_12[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 12]]
The second mechanism is similar to the agent-driven negotiation also
described in section 12 of the HTTP 1.1 specification. The difference
being that the "`list of available representations … [each with] its own
URI`" is provided by the DAP4 Dataset Services response rather than in
response to an initial request.

Clients need not retrieve the Dataset Services response in order to
access the normative representations of either the Dataset Metadata or
Data responses, as these responses are required for every DAP4 server
and are mapped to well known URL patterns. If clients attempt to access
other representations or other services using agent-driven negotiation
without first checking the Dataset Services response, they should be
prepared to receive a 404 Not Found response.

When using server-driven negotiation, DAP4 clients are encouraged to, at
a minimum, include
"`Accept`"[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_14.1[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 14.1]]and
"`User-Agent`"[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_14.43[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 14.43]]
headers in their requests and to provide accurate and detailed
information in the values of those headers. However, when server-driven
negotiation is used, DAP4 servers are not limited to those headers for
determining the media type that is returned. DAP4 clients should also be
prepared to handle 415 "`Unsupported Media type`" response codes.

==== [#Redirects .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.2# Redirects#

While HTTP redirects are not directly part of the DAP4 web protocol it
is strongly suggested that DAP4 client implementations be capable of
processing HTTP redirects as nominally described in the HTTP-1.1
specification sections on redirection status codes and redirection
response
headers.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616[HTTP RFC2616]][https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_10.3[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 10.3]][https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_-_Section_14.30[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 14.30]]
(It is suggested that implementers of DAP4 clients utilize an existing
robust HTTP client library that will manage this for them.)

==== [#Caching_of_Responses_and_Conditional_Requests .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.3# Caching of Responses and Conditional Requests#

While, HTTP caching and conditional requests are not explicitly part of
the DAP4 web protocol, they do provide important tools for improving the
performance of both sides client server interaction. Therefore, it is
strongly suggested that DAP4 servers and client implementers be aware of
how HTTP caching
[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_-_Section_13[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 13]]
works, and utilize it for working with DAP servers.

==== [#Authentication/Authorization]##[#Authentication.2FAuthorization .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.4# Authentication/Authorization#

Authentication is the process by which a user agent establishes the
identity of the user to a server, and the server establishes it’s
identity with the user agent. While, HTTP authentication is not
explicitly part of the DAP4 web protocol, it does provide important
tools for securing the client server interaction. Therefore, it is
strongly suggested that DAP4 servers and client implementers be aware of
how HTTP authentication works, and utilize it for working with DAP
servers.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2617[HTTP RFC2617]]
Server implementers should pay particular attention to HTTP security
considerations.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_15[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 15]]

Authorization is the process through which a server determines who/what
has access to its various holdings and services. The HTTP protocol does
not directly address the issue of authorization (even though HTTP
defines the 401 response status using the word "`authorization`" it does
not provide separate semantics for authentication and authorization
which we see as an important distinction for data access), but any DAP4
server implementer should be aware that some kind of mechanism for
controlling access to holdings and services will likely be desired by
the people that install and operate their software.

===== [#Request_Headers .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.5.1# Request Headers#

These are the HTTP request headers that DAP clients using HTTP MAY
utilize. DAP4 servers MUST accept these headers and act on them in a

The server MAY utilize this header, if present, to alter the
Content-Type of the response to something that is more likely to be
digestible by the requesting client
software.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_14.17[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 14.17]]

====== [#DAP_Specific .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.5.1.2# DAP Specific#

There are no DAP specific headers required to make a general DAP
request.

===== [#Response_Headers .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.5.2# Response Headers#

These are the HTTP response headers that DAP servers using HTTP MUST and
SHOULD (as indicated) return.

====== [#General_2 .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.5.2.1# General#

Date +
DAP4 servers MUST return an HTTP *Date* header whose value is the time
of the response and which MUST be in RFC 1123 date/time
format.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#RFC1123[RFC1123]]

Last-Modified +
DAP4 servers SHOULD return an HTTP *Last-Modified* header whose value is
the last modified time of the request resource and which MUST be in RFC
1123 date/time
format.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#RFC1123[RFC1123]]

Content-Type +
DAP4 servers MUST return an HTTP *Content-Type* header, the value of
which SHOULD be set in accordance with the Dap4 Resource Roles and Media
Types discussion in section 1.1 of this document.

Content-Description +
DAP4 servers SHOULD return an HTTP *Content-Description* header.

Content-Disposition +
DAP4 servers SHOULD return an HTTP *Content-Disposition* header when
transmitting file typed responses.

Content-Encoding +
DAP4 servers MUST return an HTTP *Content-Encoding* header when the
content-coding of an entity is not "`identity`".

====== [#DAP_Specific_2 .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.5.2.2# DAP Specific#

X-DAP-Server +
DAP4 servers SHOULD return the *X-DAP-Server* HTTP header. This HTTP
header is used in a response to communicate the software version of the
server. This may be a simple string with the server name and version
number, or multiple software component versions may be represented. The
value of this header is a string determined by the implementations
author(s).

*Example*

X-DAP-Server: bes/3.10.0, libdap/3.11.2, dap-server/ascii/4.1.2,
csv_handler/1.0.2, freeform_handler/3.8.4, fits_handler/1.0.7,
fileout_netcdf/1.1.2, gateway_module/1.1.0, hdf4_handler/3.9.4,
hdf5_handler/1.5.0, netcdf_handler/3.10.0, ncml_module/1.2.1,
dap-server/usage/4.1.2, dap-server/www/4.1.2, xml_data_handler/1.0.1

*Example*

X-DAP-Server: TDS-4.19.3

X-DAP +
DAP4 servers MUST return the *X-DAP* HTTP header. This HTTP header is
used in a response to indicate the DAP protocol version used to encode
the content of the response. This value is constrained to a format of
_"`major_version`" dot "`minor version`"_, where both major_version and
minor_version are represented by an integer value.

*Example*

X-DAP: 4.0

*Example*

X-DAP: 2.17

==== [#Status_Codes .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.6# Status Codes#

DAP servers that provide an HTTP interface are expected to utilize the
HTTP response codes in a manner consistent with the HTTP 1.1
specification.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616[HTTP RFC2616]]

The ones that are detailed here are used by the DAP in a manner
consistent with the specifications definition, but in support of
specific DAP server behavior.

===== [#200_OK .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.6.1# 200 OK#

A server MUST return an HTTP status of 200 when the request has been
successful and that the returned document contains the requested
resource. However since DAP responses can be quite large and since it is
also possible for the server to encounter any number of problems during
the marshaling, serialization, and subsequent transmission of the
response it is possible that the server may have committed/transmitted
the HTTP headers (in which the status value is transmitted) before a
subsequent error is encountered. These types of errors are transmitted
in the DAP4 over-the-wire protocol and all DAP4 clients MUST be able to
read and process these errors.

===== [#400_Bad_Request .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.6.2# 400 Bad Request#

The HTTP specification defines this status code as:

_The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed
syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without
modifications._[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_10.4.1[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 10.4.1]]

DAP4 servers utilizes this code to mean the following.

====== [#400_Bad_DAP4_Request_Syntax .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.6.2.1# 400 Bad DAP4 Request Syntax#

The *400 Bad DAP4 Request Syntax* HTTP response code MUST be returned by
the server when there is a problem with the syntax of the OPeNDAP URL.
The problem could be in the formulation of the constraint expression, or
it may be that the URL extension did not match any that are recognized
by this server.

===== [#401_Unauthorized .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.6.3# 401 Unauthorized#

The *401 Unauthorized* HTTP response code MUST be returned by the server
when access to the requested resource requires (not previously acquired)
user authentication. See the HTTP specification-1.1 for usage and
behavior.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_10.4.2[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 10.4.2]]

===== [#403_Forbidden .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.6.4# 403 Forbidden#

The *403 Forbidden* HTTP response code MUST be returned when the server
has understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization
will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated. This is
appropriate to return if, for example, the server software does not have
read permission for the requested
resource.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_10.4.4[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 10.4.4]]

===== [#404_Not_Found .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.6.5# 404 Not Found#

The *404 Not Found* HTTP response code MUST be returned when the server
has not found anything matching the
Request-URI.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_10.4.5[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 10.4.5]]

===== [#415_Unsupported_Media_Type .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.6.6# 415 Unsupported Media Type#

The *415 Unsupported Media Type* HTTP response code MUST be returned
when the client requests a representation of the requested resource that
the server cannot
provide.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_10.4.16[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 10.4.16]]

===== [#500_Internal_Server_Error .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.6.7# 500 Internal Server Error#

The *500 Internal Server Error* status code SHOULD be returned when the
DAP server encounters internal problems when attempting to fulfill a
request.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_10.5.1[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 10.5.1]]

==== [#Verbs_(aka_Methods)]##[#Verbs_.28aka_Methods.29 .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.7# Verbs (aka Methods)#

===== [#GET .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.7.1# GET#

A DAP4 request may be made using the HTTP GET request method utilizing a
Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that encodes information specific to
the DAP4.

Each GET request MUST conform to the HTTP specification (which basically
says that a GET request MUST contain an HTTP protocol version number
followed by a MIME-like message containing various headers that further
describe the request.). While there are some optional DAP4 HTTP request
headers that may be used, DAP4 requests do not require specific HTTP
headers beyond those necessary for HTTP (see section 4.5.1 Request
Headers of this document for more). DAP4 servers SHOULD support the use
of the HTTP Accept request header to allow clients to engage in HTTP
content negotiation for specific representations of a requested DAP4
response.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#HTTP_RFC2616_Section_12[HTTP RFC2616 - Section 12]]

The DAP server responds to the GET request with an HTTP compliant
response (one that includes a status line containing the HTTP protocol
version and an error or success code, followed by HTTP response headers
and then response itself). There are two DAP specific HTTP headers that
are always included in a DAP response over HTTP: X-DAP-Server and X-DAP,
as described in section 4.5.2 of this document. The DAP response is the
payload of the HTTP response. Unless otherwise negotiated, the data
response payload is encoded using the chunked format as described in
[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#DAP4_Vol1[DAP4
Vol.1]], while the other responses are simple HTTP responses.

====== [#Examples .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#4.7.1.1# Examples#

HTTP GET request.

....
GET /dap/path/data.nc.dap?/u,/v[0:8:1024] HTTP/1.1
Host: server.org
Accept: application/vnd.opendap.dap4.data
....

=== [#DAP4_URLs .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#5# DAP4 URLs#

In DAP4 we divide a dataset URL into two sections, the _identifier_ and
the _query string_. The _identifier_ section is everything up to
"`__?__`" character. The _query string_ is the "`__?__`" character and
everything after it.

For example in the URL:

*http://test.opendap.org:8080/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dmr?dap4.ce=/u;/lat;/lon*

We have:

_identifier =_
*http://test.opendap.org:8080/opendap/data/nc/fnoc1.nc.dmr*

_query string =_ *?dap4.ce=/u;/lat;/lon*

Additionally DAP4 URLs conform to the web convention in which the query
string is decomposed as a set of key-value pairs (KVP) separated from
each other by "`**&**`" characters:

`+?key=value&key=value&key=value ...+`

Many web services utilize this pattern, including OGC. The DAP2
constraint expression subsumed the entire query string, so it did not
fit into the standard KVP model. Tomcat (and other web server
frameworks) provide specific API methods for collecting the KVP from the
query string, but again DAP2 doesn’t play well with this. The DAP4
constraint is designed to operate in a KVP environment.

==== [#Query_String_Parameters .mw-headline]#[.mw-headline-number]#5.1# Query String Parameters#

* DAP4 query string parameters will always begin with the 5 character
string "`**dap4.**`" In this way query string parameters associated with
the DAP4 protocol can be easily identified by both people and software.
* DAP4 query string keys are case sensitive.
* DAP4 servers MUST treat ALL values of query string KVPs as case
sensitive.
* Each DAP4 key may appear once in each query string (request URL).
* The order of the keys does not matter, and unrecognized keys are
ignored, along with their values.

The DAP4 protocol reserves the exclusive use of all future query string
keys that begin with the 4 character token "`**dap4.**`" This way future
DAP4 service features may be added and invoked through the query string
section of the request URL without interfering with other features and
behaviors added to service implementations outside of the DAP4
development process.

The following keys are reserved.

dap4.ce +
The DAP4 constraint expression is contained in a single query string
parameter named "`**dap4.ce**`" This constraint expression contains all
of the subsetting information for the dataset include the projection
(which variables are to be returned), slicing (how the various arrays
are to be decimated), and filtering (conditional retrieval of values).
The fill discussion of the syntax of the constraint expression can be
found in Section 8 of Volume 1 of the DAP4 specification.
[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#DAP4_Vol1[DAP4 Vol.1]]

dap4.async +
The asynchronous response behavior is described in detail in Section 10
of Volume 1 of the DAP4
Specification.[https://docs.opendap.org/index.php?title=DAP4:_Specification_Volume_2#DAP4_Vol1[DAP4 Vol.1]]
While the a DAP4 server’s asynchronous response behavior can be
controlled by a savvy client using HTTP headers it can also be managed
using the DAP4 query string parameter "`**dap4.async**`"

dap4.func +
While server-side functions are not addressed in the initial DAP4
specification or constraint expression syntax we do anticipate them
being defined (in short order) in an extension to the DAP4
specification. For now we are working with a proposed server side
function syntax in which a server side function is invoked as a key
value pair, something like: *dap4.func=ugr5(0,v,z,”10<lat<30”)*
